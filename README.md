utilities
=========

Catch-all repo for social media research utilities 

* tweetutils.py is a super messy catch-all module with random functions that I find myself writing over and over
* activitystreams2mongo.py is a simple script for inserting a bunch of tweets in Activity Streams format into a Mongo DB collection
